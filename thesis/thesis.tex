\section{Introduction}

The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a promising vision which enables trillions of sensor devices to connect, contributing to a smarter and better world. A bottleneck for such devices is the energy supply. Batteries are large, expensive, heavy and wear out after several years.

A more sustainable solution than batteries, is energy harvesting where a device collects it's energy from the environment i.e. solar, radio frequency (RF) or kinetic energy.
